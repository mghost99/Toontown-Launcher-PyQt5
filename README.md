# Toontown-Launcher-PyQt5
 A recreation of the original Toontown launcher that utilizes the startshow and ver files of the original. Primarily made for "Final Toontown 2013" but can be adapted for others too.

This launcher is utilizing the Sunrise Games patcher files. As the ``WEB_PAGE_LOGIN_RPC`` variable in `patcher.ver` is using `GET` we are using their alternate `POST` api.
