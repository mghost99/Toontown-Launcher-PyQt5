# Toontown-Launcher-PySide2
 A recreation of the original Toontown launcher that utilizes the startshow and ver files of the original. Primarily made for Sunrise Games "Final Toontown" but can be adapted for others too.

This launcher is utilizing the Sunrise Games patcher files. As the ``WEB_PAGE_LOGIN_RPC`` variable in `patcher.ver` is using `GET` we are using their alternate `POST` api (hardcoded).
